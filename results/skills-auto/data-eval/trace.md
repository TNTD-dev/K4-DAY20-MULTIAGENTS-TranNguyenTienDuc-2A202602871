### Human
Analyse the order events in `workspace/orders.json` (see `workspace/README.md` for the field descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `march_revenue_utc` (number): sum of `total` of the orders placed in March 2024, where the month is determined in **UTC**.
- `march_orders_utc` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `march_revenue_utc`.
- `top_category` (string): the category with the highest total revenue over the whole file (lowercase name).
- `missing_total_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose total is missing.
- `duplicate_events_removed` (integer): number of duplicate events you removed.

Orders with a missing total must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

# orders.json - data dictionary

A JSON array of order events.

| field | description |
|---|---|
| id | order identifier. An event may be delivered more than once; keep the first event of each id. |
| placed_at | ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset (`Z`, `+07:00`, `-05:00`, ...). |
| category | product category. Spelling, capitalisation and surrounding spaces are not consistent. |
| total | order total in USD, as a number or as a string such as `"1,250.00"`. The value `-1` means the total is unknown (missing). |

### Assistant
I processed the order events from `workspace/orders.json` and created the file `workspace/answer.json` with the required keys. Here’s a summary of the data cleaning steps I performed:

1. **Duplicate Events Removal**: I checked for duplicate orders based on their IDs and removed any duplicates, counting how many were removed.
2. **Total Value Normalization**: I converted total values from strings to floats, removing commas where necessary. Any total that could not be converted was treated as missing.
3. **Category Normalization**: I standardized the category names by trimming whitespace and converting them to lowercase.
4. **Revenue Calculation**: I calculated the total revenue for orders placed in March 2024 (in UTC) and counted the distinct orders for that month.
5. **Missing Totals Count**: I counted the number of distinct orders that had a missing total.

The resulting `answer.json` file contains the calculated metrics as specified.
